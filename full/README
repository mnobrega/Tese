This set of files provide a template for using LaTeX to write a Master
or PhD thesis according to the IST regulations.

The main file is 'Thesis.tex' and it includes all the other .tex files
in the ZIP package:

	Thesis.TeX
		Thesis_Preamble.tex
		Thesis_FrontCover.tex
		Thesis_Dedication.tex
		Thesis_Acknowledgements.tex
		Thesis_Resumo.tex
		Thesis_Abstract.tex
		Thesis_Nomenclature.tex
		Thesis_Introduction.tex
		Thesis_<new chapters>.tex
		Thesis_Results.tex
		Thesis_Conclusions.tex
		Thesis_Appendix.tex
		Thesis_bib_DB.bib

It is not required that you are familiar with LaTeX since the files
should be quite self explanatory.
Please be sure you understand the structure before you start editing.

Just use the make file 'Makefile' to process the LaTeX code and output
the PDF file. Under Linux, this means typing 'make' at the terminal prompt.
