  abstract = {Over the past decade we have witnessed the evolution of wireless sensor
	networks, with advancements in hardware design, communication protocols,
	resource efficiency, and other aspects. Recently, there has been
	much focus on mobile sensor networks, and we have even seen the development
	of small-profile sensing devices that are able to control their own
	movement. Although it has been shown that mobility alleviates several
	issues relating to sensor network coverage and connectivity, many
	challenges remain. Among these, the need for position estimation
	is perhaps the most important. Not only is localization required
	to understand sensor data in a spatial context, but also for navigation,
	a key feature of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present a survey
	on localization methods for mobile wireless sensor networks. We provide
	taxonomies for mobile wireless sensors and localization, including
	common architectures, measurement techniques, and localization algorithms.
	We conclude with a description of real-world mobile sensor applications
	that require position estimation.},

  abstract = {{Sensor webs consisting of nodes with limited battery power and wireless
	communications are deployed to collect useful information from the
	field. Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner
	is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time.
	In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000),
	a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication,
	each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station.
	If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station
	then it will deplete its power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented
	by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are
	formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing
	the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, LEACH achieves
	a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured
	in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (power-efficient
	gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based
	protocol that is an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node
	communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting
	to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per
	round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than
	LEACH by about 100 to 300\% when 1\%, 20\%, 50\%, and 100\% of nodes
	die for different network sizes and topologies.}},
